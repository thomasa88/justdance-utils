# Just Dance Now Utilities

This repository contains userscripts for Just Dance Now. They are
tested with [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) but should also work with [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

The utilities are released under the GPL v3.0 license.

## Verse

Verse adds a search box to the dance room, for easy access to all available songs.

### Installation

First, make sure you have the [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) add-on installed in your browser.

Then, install Verse using this link: **[Installation link](https://github.com/thomasa88/justdance-utils/raw/master/verse.user.js)**

ViolentMonkey will open the script. Click "Confirm installation" in the top right, to finish the installation.

You can now open [Just Dance Now](https://justdancenow.com).

## Song Counter

Simple counter that counts the number of started songs in the current room.

The counter is added to the top right of the screen.

Note: Only songs started from the web browser are counted.

## Enter Room

~~Automatically enters the dance room and dismisses the autoplay confirmation, when opening the Just Dance Now website.~~

This script is flawed. Clicking away the autoplay indication makes the songs not play. The functionality to enter a room automatically is not really needed, since the room is entered as soon as someone joins with a phone.
